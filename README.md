# PythonRPG
A standard turn-based classic styled RPG made in Python with some JSON support
This is a project I made to help me understand python more, I'm gonna update it a bit if I can adding more classes and support. It's a basic
turn based rpg with some interesting mechanics. You can play as several classes and go against random monsters everytime.
